# programmeerproject
This project will visualize all the vulcanoes in the world and answer the question whether there is a correlation between types of  vulcanoes and the number of eruptions and possibly the number of deaths.

The main features of this project are the countries, the name and type and of the volcanoes, the number of eruptions and the number of deaths. This are also the minimum viable product. In addition, the year of (historical) eruptions could be included to make a timeline.

Data will be obtained from http://volcano.si.edu/list_volcano_holocene.cfm and https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/servlet/ShowDatasets?dataset=102557&search_look=50&display_look=50. The data must be transformed into JSON objects before use.
