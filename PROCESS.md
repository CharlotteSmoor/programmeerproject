# day 4
- processed my data by converting it from a csv file to JSON
- loaded the data and imported a world map
- linked html, thought about the design of the project and finished prototype

# day 5
- presented the progress of my project to fellow classmates

# day 6
- found out the JSON format contained errors, so I needed to clean the dataset

# day 7
- linked the data with world map

# day 8
- Created a donutchart showing all the different types of volcanos that exist in the world. Had a few problems with placing the chart on the webpage in a way that it would look appealing to the user.

# day 9
- Found out that I needed to make more changed to my dataset in order to make all the visualisations. Originally, the data was processed in javascript which made loading my webpage very slow. I started to transform the data in python.

# day 10
- presented my project to classmates and discussed all the problems I had with my dataset. Later on, I worked on the python code which would transform the data in a more convenient way.

# day 11
- I made a few changes in the python code and created the worldmap based on the new dataset. I also added a slider which allows the user to see in which year in which country a volcano erupted.

# day 12
- Completed an update function for the map that allows the slider to change the values. After that, I started working on the donut chart which shows all types existing in one country. If the user clicks on a country on the map, a donutchart appears. However the counter for the donutchart does not show the correct amount yet.
